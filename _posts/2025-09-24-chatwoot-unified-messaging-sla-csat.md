## One operational inbox, many storefronts

Each Meridian brand keeps its own tone and audience. In the **Chatwoot** admin we configure separate inboxes (email, web chat, Facebook, Google Business Messages) per brand, but staff them with a **shared team**. It’s all UI: logos, colors, signatures, rules.

Why this matters:
- **Speed**: pooled agents reduce idle time.  
- **Consistency**: one macro library and QA rubric.  
- **Coverage**: after-hours is simpler with a unified queue.

## Tasteful, on-brand presentation from the UI

We avoid “holding-company” vibes with brand-aware settings:
- **Logos & colors per inbox** (favicon, chat bubble, signature).
- **Voice guidance**: a short do/don’t list lives in the knowledge base.
- **Local details**: city names, phone numbers, service areas are injected via brand metadata fields.

No code required—just clean configuration.

## SLA by intent, not by channel

Channel targets can hide real priorities. We configure **intent tags** and measure SLAs by intent:
- **Sales / quotes**: 5 minutes first response  
- **Active jobs (day-of)**: 10 minutes  
- **General inquiries**: 60 minutes  
- **After hours**: reply before 9am local

Agents apply a small set of intent tags; dashboards show SLA performance by brand and intent.

## Templates that read human

We keep templates **short** and editable in the UI:
- **Quote prompts** (origin/destination, elevator/stairs, date, size).  
- **Prep checklists** (parking, elevator bookings, fragile items).  
- **Issue intake** (damaged items: photo, description, next steps).

Rules we train to:
- Personalize with variables (brand, first name).  
- Link out for anything longer than a few lines.  
- Review usage analytics monthly; retire the low-performers.

## Ownership and swarming without ping-pong

- **Ownership**: the first capable agent takes a thread and keeps it.  
- **Swarming**: complex cases trigger an internal note, not a hand-off.  
- **Escalation**: dispatch and on-site supervisors are in a mention group.

The result is fewer “who has this?” moments and better continuity for the customer.

---

## Analytics that drive changes (not dashboards for dashboards’ sake)

We review weekly, right from the UI:
- **Time to first response** by intent and brand.  
- **Closure time** and **reopen rate**.  
- **Macro effectiveness** (conversion, deflection, CSAT impact).  
- **Top five blockers** (missing elevator bookings, under-declared items, parking).

We assign owners to the worst two metrics and check back the next week—small, steady improvements.

## What we’ve seen

- **Faster replies** (intent-level SLA focus cut first responses by ~40–55% at peaks).  
- **Higher CSAT** (consistent tone, clear next steps).  
- **Cleaner handoffs** (notes + ownership reduce context loss).

Unified doesn’t mean generic. With brand-aware configuration, intent routing, and a few great templates, customers feel cared for and ops stays calm.
