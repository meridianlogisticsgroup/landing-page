**Effective date:** July 1, 2025

Meridian Logistics Group Inc. ("**Meridian**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**") operates a portfolio of local and long-distance moving and storage brands. In this Policy, **"Brands"** means any moving, storage, or related logistics services operated by Meridian under distinct trade names (including but not limited to **Care Full Moving**, **Vancouver’s Movers**, **Toronto Pro Moving**, and **Foothills Movers**) that follow Meridian’s unified operating playbook and platform. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information when you interact with Meridian or any of our Brands online or offline.

This Policy is designed to meet requirements under Canada’s **PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and, where applicable, **Alberta PIPA** and **BC PIPA**. If you are located in **Quebec**, additional rights under **Quebec’s Act respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector (Law 25)** may apply (see "Quebec Notice" below). If you are outside Canada, local law may grant additional rights.

## What We Collect

### 1) Information you provide
- **Identity & Contact:** name, phone number, email address.
- **Service Details:** origin and destination addresses; building/access notes (e.g., stairs, elevator bookings, parking); inventory/item details; preferred dates and time windows; instructions you provide to our crew or dispatch.
- **Account/Booking Data:** quotes/estimates, booking confirmations, invoices, customer service interactions, feedback and reviews.
- **Payment-Related:** payment method, transaction amounts, authorization status, refunds/adjustments. *We do not store full payment instrument numbers on our systems; payment processing is handled by secure third-party providers that are **PCI DSS** compliant.*
- **Optional Documents (only when necessary):** proof of authorization to book (e.g., property manager letters), elevator reservations, images/photos related to logistics, or verification documents. *Sensitive uploads are stored in access-controlled repositories with encryption at rest, limited to staff with a business need, and deleted per the Retention section or upon verified request where legally permitted.*

### 2) Information collected automatically (online)
- **Technical Data:** IP address, device/browser type, pages visited, and timestamps.
- **Cookies & Similar Tech:** used for session management, security, preferences, and analytics. See **Cookies & Analytics** below.

### 3) Information from third parties
- **Payment & Risk Partners (e.g., **Clik2Pay**, **Stripe**, banks, and fraud-screening services):** payment status, fraud/risk signals, bank/payment confirmations, and compliance checks relevant to the transaction.
- **Maps & Dispatch Tools:** distance/time estimates, routing, and geocoding derived from the addresses you provide.
- **Subcontractors/Carriers:** job status updates and proof of service when we engage trusted partners to perform or assist with your move.

> **Note on KYC/AML:** In limited cases (e.g., fraud prevention, high-value transactions, business account billing), we or our payment partners may request additional verification information as required by law or by the partner’s compliance rules. We will request only what is reasonably necessary, explain why it’s needed, and protect such information appropriately.

## How We Use Personal Information (Purposes)

We use personal information to:
- **Provide Services:** create quotes, schedule jobs, plan routes, dispatch crews, complete moves, and manage storage.
- **Communicate:** confirmations, reminders, operational updates, and customer support.
- **Billing & Reconciliation:** take payment on arrival (estimate total), issue receipts, reconcile time/material differences at job completion (refund if shorter; additional charge if longer), and handle disputes/chargebacks.
- **Fraud & Security:** verify transactions; detect and prevent fraud or misuse; protect our customers, staff, and systems (including automated risk screening with human review where appropriate); maintain audit logs.
- **Legal & Compliance:** maintain records, meet tax and accounting obligations, comply with court orders or lawful requests.
- **Analytics & Improvements (Legitimate Interests):** understand service performance, quality control, training, and product development for our unified operating platform. We use aggregated or de-identified data where possible and apply data minimization.

> **Payment Timing & Adjustments (Informational):** Operational details about deposits, final billing, refunds, or additional charges are part of your **Terms & Conditions/Service Agreement**. This Privacy Policy explains only how related **personal information** is used and protected.

---

## Lawful Bases for Processing
- **Contract:** to provide the services you request (quotes, bookings, dispatch, and billing).
- **Legitimate Interests:** secure operations, fraud prevention, service improvements, and business analytics (balanced with your privacy rights). *You may object to processing based on legitimate interests—see **Your Rights**.*
- **Consent:** where required (e.g., optional marketing communications, certain cookies, or specific sensitive uploads). We will obtain **explicit consent** when applicable and you can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Legal Obligation:** tax, accounting, records retention, and responses to lawful requests.

---

## Sharing & Disclosures

We do **not** sell your personal information. We may share information with:
- **Our Brands and Affiliates:** to deliver a consistent, high-quality service across regions.
- **Service Providers:** payment processors (e.g., **Clik2Pay**, **Stripe**), banks, risk/fraud tools, dispatch/routing platforms, cloud hosting, IT/security vendors, CRM, communications (email/SMS), and analytics providers—**bound by contracts** requiring confidentiality, data protection, and use only for our instructions.
- **Subcontractors/Partner Carriers:** vetted moving partners engaged to perform or assist with a job (limited to operational details needed to complete your service) under **contractual confidentiality and data-protection obligations**.
- **Legal/Compliance:** regulators, law enforcement, courts, or advisors when legally required or to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
- **Business Transactions:** in the event of a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, subject to appropriate safeguards and continued protection consistent with this Policy.

**Clik2Pay Specificity:** Where you choose bank transfer via Clik2Pay, your bank/account details are collected and processed by **Clik2Pay** (and/or its financial partners). Meridian receives payment confirmations and limited risk/fraud signals but does **not** receive or store your full bank credentials.

---

## International Transfers
Our systems or service providers may store or process data outside your province or outside Canada (e.g., secure cloud hosting in the U.S.). We implement safeguards such as **data processing agreements**, **standardized contractual clauses**, vendor **security due diligence**, and technical controls (encryption in transit/at rest where feasible) to ensure that foreign service providers offer a level of protection **comparable** to Canadian standards, recognizing that information may be subject to the laws of those jurisdictions.

---

## Retention
We retain personal information only as long as necessary for:
- **Service Delivery & Records:** job records for customer support and warranty.
- **Accounting & Tax:** generally **7 years** (or longer where the law requires).
- **Disputes & Compliance:** for the duration of any dispute plus applicable limitation periods.
- **Payment/Risk Data:** for periods required by our payment partners and applicable regulations.

Retention periods are determined by legal requirements and legitimate business needs. When information is no longer required, we securely delete or anonymize it.

Subject to applicable law, you may:
- **Access** your personal information and obtain a copy.
- **Correct** inaccurate or incomplete information.

- **Object or restrict** processing based on **legitimate interests**, where permitted by law.
- **Delete** information (subject to legal/contractual retention requirements).
- **Data portability** (machine-readable export) where feasible.

We aim to respond to verified requests **within 30 days**. To exercise your rights, contact **privacy@meridianlogisticsgroup.com**. We may need to verify your identity.

You may also escalate concerns to the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)** or to your **provincial privacy regulator** after first giving us an opportunity to respond.

## Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information, including:
- **Encryption in transit** (TLS) and **encryption at rest** where feasible.
- **Access controls** (least privilege), **role-based permissions**, and **multi-factor authentication** for staff where applicable.
- **Network and application security** hardening, logging, and monitoring.

- Where required, we display a **cookie banner** that allows you to **accept, reject, or manage** non-essential cookies. You can also adjust your browser settings; disabling certain cookies may affect site functionality.

## CASL & Marketing

We comply with **Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)**. We send commercial emails/SMS only with your consent or as otherwise permitted by law. You can **unsubscribe** at any time using the link or instructions in our messages or by contacting **privacy@meridianlogisticsgroup.com**.
