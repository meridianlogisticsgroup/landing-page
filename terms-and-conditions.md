# Terms and Conditions
**Effective date:** July 1, 2025

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern moving, storage, packing, and related services ("Services") provided by **Meridian Logistics Group Inc.** ("Meridian", "we", "us", "our") and all Brands we operate (including but not limited to Care Full Moving, Vancouver's Movers, Toronto Pro Moving, and Foothills Movers). By booking or receiving Services, the customer ("you", "your") agrees to these Terms.

> **Plain language summary:** You pay a deposit to book, then the estimate amount before work starts on service day. We reconcile at the end based on actual time, distance, and materials used. You handle access (elevators/parking/keys), safe items, and prohibited items. Liability is limited unless you buy separate coverage.

---

## 1) Definitions
- **Estimate:** Our good-faith projection of time, distance, materials, crew size, and fees based on information you provide.
- **Job:** The Services scheduled for the date(s) on your confirmation (including any add-ons or changes agreed later).
- **Materials:** Boxes, pads, tape, shrink wrap, mattress bags, bubble wrap, crates, floor protection, and similar supplies.
- **Accessorial charges:** Extra charges for stairs, long carries, hoisting, shuttles, parking issues, wait time, oversized or specialty items, etc.
- **High-risk customer:** A customer or Job we reasonably assess as having an elevated risk of non-payment or fraud (e.g., prior chargeback, mismatched ID, unusual instructions, refusal to show ID).
- **Card on file:** A payment token stored by our PCI-compliant processor that allows us to charge your card under these Terms.

---

## 2) Quotes, Estimates, and Scope
2.1 **Non-binding.** Estimates are non-binding and depend on accurate information and actual site conditions. Changes in inventory, access, parking, elevators, hallways, stairs, packing quality, or unforeseen conditions may affect total cost and duration.

2.2 **Inventory & access info.** You must provide complete and accurate details before the Job (addresses, parking, elevator booking windows, stairs, loading areas, special items, packing status, building rules). We may adjust crew, equipment, and pricing if facts differ on arrival.

2.3 **Minimums and rounding.** Unless otherwise stated in your confirmation:
- A minimum time charge (e.g., 2–3 hours) may apply.
- Time is billed in increments (e.g., 15 minutes) after the minimum.
- Travel time, fueling, and setup/pack-down may be chargeable.
- A fuel or service-area surcharge may apply.

2.4 **Subcontracting.** We may use vetted subcontractors or partner carriers to perform any part of the Services. These Terms apply to their work as if performed by us.

---

## 3) Booking, Deposits, and Payments
3.1 **Deposit to secure date (non-refundable).** A non-refundable deposit (typically CAD $50–$250, as shown at booking) secures your date and is applied to your final bill. If you reschedule with at least **48 hours’ notice**, we will apply your deposit as a credit to a new date within **90 days**, subject to availability. If **we** cancel and cannot offer a reasonable alternative, we will refund the deposit.

3.2 **Estimate payment before start.** On service day and **before work begins**, you must pay the **estimate amount** shown on your confirmation (less deposit). Accepted methods may include card, **Clik2Pay** bank transfer, Interac e-Transfer, or bank transfer (availability varies by region). If payment is not received, we may delay or refuse service.

3.3 **Reconciliation at completion.** At Job completion, we reconcile based on actual time, distance (km), Materials, accessorial charges, and taxes. If the **actual total is less** than the estimate, we refund the difference. If **greater**, you must pay the balance immediately.

3.4 **High-risk staged billing.** For high-risk Jobs, we may:
- Perform only the portion of work covered by the **estimate payment** already received (e.g., 5 hours and ~10 km).
- Prepare a **second estimate** for remaining work and require payment **before** continuing.
- **Pause** the Job during reconciliation; a **15-minute grace period** applies, after which waiting time is billable if delays are caused by your payment arrangements. If excessive delays occur or we reasonably suspect non-payment or fraud, we may end the Job and depart.

3.5 **Card on file & authorizations.** You authorize us and our PCI-compliant processor to:
- Store a token of your card for deposits, estimate payments, reconciliations, additional approved work, damages, tolls/parking tickets attributable to your Job, and agreed fees.
- Capture additional charges under these Terms (e.g., balance due at completion, add-ons you approve onsite, missed-payment reconciliation).

3.6 **Clik2Pay / Interac e-Transfer / bank transfer.** If you pay via Clik2Pay or bank transfer, you authorize verification, fraud checks, and payment confirmations by the payment partner(s). We do not store your full bank credentials.

3.7 **Failed/returned payments.** You are responsible for **NSF/returned-payment fees** and any third-party processing fees we incur. We may suspend or withhold delivery until cleared funds are received.

3.8 **Chargebacks and fees.** If you initiate a chargeback contrary to these Terms and we prevail, you are responsible for our reasonable administrative, attorney, and processing fees, plus any interest permitted by law.

3.9 **Late payment & interest.** Overdue balances may accrue interest at the lesser of **2% per month (24% per annum)** or the maximum permitted by law, plus reasonable collection costs.

---

## 4) Pricing, Surcharges, and Accessorials
4.1 **Hourly/time-based charges.** Billed for actual crew labor, including packing/unpacking, loading/unloading, assembly/disassembly, wait time caused by access or customer-related delays, and reasonable breaks per law.

4.2 **Distance/transport.** Kilometres are measured using industry-standard mapping (actual route may vary due to traffic or restrictions). Tolls, ferry fees, and required permits are chargeable.

4.3 **Materials.** Materials used are charged at prevailing rates unless included in your package.

4.4 **Accessorial charges** (examples):
- Stairs/long carry, shuttle service, hoisting, narrow access, multi-stop routing.
- Appliance servicing (disconnect/reconnect only if explicitly offered; see Section 7).
- Specialty items (pianos, safes, large artwork, glass, marble, gym equipment).
- Parking tickets or bylaw fines arising from **your instructions** (e.g., “park here” in a restricted zone) are your responsibility.

4.5 **After-hours/holiday rate.** Jobs outside standard hours or on statutory holidays may carry premium rates.

## 5) Scheduling, Delays, and Cancellations
5.1 **Arrival windows.** We provide an arrival window, not a guaranteed start time, due to traffic, weather, prior Job overruns, and safety.

5.2 **Your obligations.** You must have keys, elevator bookings, parking arranged, and premises ready. Time spent waiting for access is billable.

5.3 **Rescheduling.** Subject to availability. Fees may apply for last-minute changes (e.g., within 48 hours) or increased scope. Deposits are handled per **3.1**.

5.4 **Cancellation.** Deposits are non-refundable. Additional cancellation fees may apply if you cancel within the period stated on your confirmation (e.g., 48 hours) or after crew dispatch. If we must cancel due to unsafe conditions, non-payment, or misrepresentation, charges for time and costs incurred will apply.

5.5 **Force majeure.** We are not liable for delays or non-performance due to causes beyond our reasonable control (e.g., severe weather, road closures, strikes, government actions, utility outages, emergencies, or third-party failures). We will use reasonable efforts to mitigate and reschedule.

6.5 **Building rules.** You must arrange elevator reservations, loading dock times, COI (if required), and comply with building rules. Additional charges apply if we need to return or wait due to missing arrangements.

6.6 **Parking.** You are responsible for legal and safe parking access. If none is available, we may park as close as reasonably possible; you bear resulting tickets/fines attributable to your instructions.

- The repair cost;
- The depreciated value at time of loss; or
- **$0.60 per pound per item** (or the minimum permitted by applicable law in your province).
